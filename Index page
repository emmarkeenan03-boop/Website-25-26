	<p> <strong> Annabel Lee by Edger Allen Poe </strong>
	<br> It was many and many a year ago,
	<br> In a kingdom by the sea,
	<br>That a maiden there lived whom you may know
	<br>By the name of Annabel Lee;
	<br>And this maiden she lived with no other thought
	<br>Than to love and be loved by me.
	<br>
	<br>I was a child and she was a child,
	<br>In this kingdom by the sea,
	<br>But we loved with a love that was more than love—
	<br>I and my Annabel Lee—
	<br>With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
	<br>Coveted her and me.
	<br>
	<br>And this was the reason that, long ago,
	<br>In this kingdom by the sea,
	<br>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
	<br>My beautiful Annabel Lee;
	<br>So that her highborn kinsmen came
	<br>And bore her away from me,
	<br>To shut her up in a sepulchre
	<br>In this kingdom by the sea.
	<br>
	<br>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
	<br>Went envying her and me—
	<br>Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
	<br>In this kingdom by the sea) 
	<br>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
	<br>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
	<br>
	<br>But our love it was stronger by far than the love
	<br>Of those who were older than we—
	<br>Of many far wiser than we—
	<br>And neither the angels in Heaven above
	<br>Nor the demons down under the sea
	<br>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
	<br>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
	<br>
	<br>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
	<br>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
	<br>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
	<br>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
	<br>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
	<br>Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
	<br>In her sepulchre there by the sea—
	<br>In her tomb by the sounding sea. </p>
